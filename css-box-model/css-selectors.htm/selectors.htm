            <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>

            <p>CSS Selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML 
            elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong>
            useful.</p>

            <p>Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select
            arbitrary boxes in your web pages.</p>

            <p>We will also be talking about links in this example, so 
            here's <a href="https://internetingishard.com">Interneting Is Hard</a> 
            for us to style.</p>

            <a class="button" href="nowhere.htm">Button One</a>
            <a id="button-2" class="button call-to-action" href="nowhere.htm">Button Two</a>
        </div>

        <div class="sidebar">
            <p>If this page had a sidebar...</p>
            <p>We'd have some problems with pseudo-classes.</p>
